# Access Controls

Access control list can allow or deny ranges of IP addresses. There are
several purposes for using the ACL.

**providers - access conroll list**

-   The main purpose of the Providers list is for your voip provider
    (carrier) IP addresses to the CIDR.
-   Be careful with what and how you use ACL.
-   Most common mistakes result in calls not working between extensions
    and other undesirable results.
-   Be sure to keep **providers** access control (formerly called
    domains) to default deny.
-   Do not put your public ip or phone IP addresses in the domains
    access control list.
-   Don\'t supply both the domain and the cidr on the same node.
-   If adding a single IP address to the CIDR field make sure to add /32
    on the end of the IP address.
