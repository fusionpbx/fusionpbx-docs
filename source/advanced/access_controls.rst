Access Controls
****************

Access control list can allow or deny ranges of IP addresses.  There are several purposes for using the ACL.

*  The main purpose is for your carriers ip addresses.  
*  Be careful with what and how you use ACL.
*  Most common mistakes result in calls not working between extensions and other undesirable results. 
*  Be sure to keep Domains access control to default deny.
*  Do not put your public ip or phone IP addresses in the domains access control list.
*  Don't supply both the domain and the cidr on the same node.
*  If adding a single IP address to the CIDR field make sure to add /32 on the end of the IP address.
