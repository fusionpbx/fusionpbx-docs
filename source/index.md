# Welcome to FusionPBX Docs

## FusionPBX

An open source project that provides a customizable and flexible web interface to the very powerful and highly scalable multi-platform voice switch called [FreeSWITCH](https://www.freeswitch.org).

FusionPBX will run on a variety of operating systems (optimized for Debian 8+) and hardware of your choice. FusionPBX provides a GUI for QR Code soft phone provisioning, unlimited extensions, voicemail-to-email, music on hold, call parking, analog lines or high-density T1/E1 circuits, and many other features. FusionPBX provides the functionality that businesses need and delivers corporate-level phone system features to small, medium, and large businesses.

2. Makes FreeSWITCH easy to administer while at the same time still allowing you to work directly within FreeSWITCH Command Line Interface (fs_cli) when you need to.
3. Gives your users and tenants an attractive GUI interface to interact with.
