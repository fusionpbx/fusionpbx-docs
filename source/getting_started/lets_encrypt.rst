Let's Encrypt
***************

Let's Encrypt is one of the most recent and widely used form of free SSL security and supports wildcard DNS.  You can use Let's Encrypt with your FusionPBX install and WebRTC like `Verto Communicator`_.


Dehydrated (Recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FusionPBX has an option to easliy and quickly install SSL with Let's Encrypt using **letsencrypt.sh**  With this script you can choose either to request an SSL certificate with wildcard (*.domain.tld) or hostnames (domain.tld).

The letsencrypt.sh will do the following:

* Download `dehydrated <https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated>`_.
* Request an SSL certificate from `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.com>`_.
* Configure NGINX to use the SSL certificate.
* Combine and place SSL certificate in the proper `FreeSWITCH <https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/FreeSWITCH+Explained>`_ directory for using TLS.
* Test and make sure the SSL cert works and outputs if sucessful.

Using letsencrypt.sh
---------------------

With letsencrypt.sh you have the choice of creating an SSL certificate for a single domain (domain.tld), multiple sub domains(sub.domain.tld, sub1.domain.tld, etc.domain.tld) or wildcard (*.domain.tld).  The easy way however is using the hostname method. 

Hostname
~~~~~~~~~~

To create a hostname or multiple hostname SSL certificate go to:

::

 cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/debian/resources/

Then execute the script.

::

 ./letsencrypt.sh
 
 
You should then see and follow the prompts.

::

 Domain Name: domain.tld
 Email Address: support@fusionpbx.com

After that, you should see the following output.

::

Wildcard
~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a wildcard SSL certificate go to:

::

 cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/debian/resources/


Then execute the script.

::

 ./letsencrypt.sh

You should then see and follow the prompts:

::

 Domain Name: *.domain.tld
 Email Address: support@fusionpbx.com
 
::

.. note::

      When you define the txt record with your domain registrar be sure to use the output of the script you are running and not what is in this example.

::

 Add the following to the zone definition of domain.tld:
 _acme-challenge.domain.tld. IN TXT "PY7ttk6no_5eG7WtAbO6qs5-NzA-Kigko375omKc0nw"

 **Press enter to continue...**

::

 + Responding to challenge for domain.tld authorization...

::

 Now you can remove the following from the zone definition of domain.tld:
 _acme-challenge.domain.tld. IN TXT "PY7ttk6no_5eG7WtAbO6qs5-NzA-Kigko375omKc0nw"

 **Press enter to continue...**

 + Creating fullchain.pem...

 deploy_cert()

 Done!

 **done**

 nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
 nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

.. tip::

       Use the dig command to check that the txt record is correct.  dig -t txt _acme-challenge.domain.tld
       
       Output should show:
       
       ;; ANSWER SECTION:
       _acme-challenge.domain.tld. 1799 IN TXT  "PY7ttk6no_5eG7WtAbO6qs5-NzA-Kigko375omKc0nw"







Certbot (Alternative Option)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certbot is optional and is more of a manual way of using Let's Encrypt SSL.  Some still use this process but most use the recommended way with the Dehydrated script.

More info on NGINX with Let's Encrypt
https://www.nginx.com/blog/free-certificates-lets-encrypt-and-nginx

**Clone Let's Encrypt**

::

 
 git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt /opt/letsencrypt

**Execute certbot-auto**

::

 cd /opt/letsencrypt
 chmod a+x ./certbot-auto
 ./certbot-auto
 cd /etc/letsencrypt/
 mkdir -p configs
 cd configs
 
**Copy code example from** `link`_ **in step #2 section and edit domains, key size, email then put into: /etc/letsencrypt/configs/domain.tld.conf** (Edit domain.tld to reflect your domain)

::

 touch /etc/letsencrypt/configs/domain.tld.conf
 vim /etc/letsencrypt/configs/domain.tld.conf
 
**Edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/fusionpbx**

::

 vim  /etc/nginx/sites-available/fusionpbx
 Add this after the ssl_ciphers line
 
 location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
         root /var/www/letsencrypt;
     }
     
 Reload and check Nginx
 nginx -t && nginx -s reload
 Should output:
 nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
 nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

**Execute Let's Encrypt script**  (Edit domain.tld to reflect your domain)
You can make up to 100 subdomain requests with using -d sub.domain.tld -d sub1.domain.tld


::

 cd /opt/letsencrypt
 ./letsencrypt-auto --config /etc/letsencrypt/configs/domain.tld.conf certonly
 Should output:
 - Congratulations! And a paragraph about the keys made and where the live.


**Edit sites-available**  (Edit domain.tld to reflect your domain)

::

 Comment out and add
 vim  /etc/nginx/sites-available/fusionpbx
        #ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx.crt;
        #ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx.key;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/privkey.pem;

Systemctl restart nginx

Now check the padlock and see if it's green!

Auto Renew certificate
------------------------

.. note::

       This will work with certbot



Renew with Crontab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Crontab can be used to renew let's encrypt.

::

 Create crontab -e
 
 2 3 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew &>/var/log/fusionpbx_certbot.cronlog
 

This executes daily at 3:02 AM (local time).  Certbot will check your existing certificate.  If it has less than 30 days' validity remaining, it will attempt to renew the certificate.  It runs daily in case a renewal attempt fails, it will just try again the next day.
 

**List crontabs**

::

 crontab -l



Setup for multiple domains on Let's Encrypt
===========================================

Before setting up multiple domains, make sure you have SSL working on your main domain using the instructions above.

**Create shared nginx host file for all domains**

``vim /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-default-config``
 
Paste the code below into the file

::

 ssl_protocols           TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
 ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!ADH:!MD5:!aNULL;

 access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
 error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

 client_max_body_size 80M;
 client_body_buffer_size 128k;

 location / {
   root /var/www/fusionpbx;
   index index.php;
 }

 location ~ \.php$ {
   fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;
   #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
   fastcgi_index index.php;
   include fastcgi_params;
   fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/fusionpbx$fastcgi_script_name;

 # Disable viewing .htaccess & .htpassword & .db
 location ~ .htaccess {
   deny all;
 }
 location ~ .htpassword {
   deny all;
 }
 location ~^.+.(db)$ {
   deny all;
 }


**Create a file to contain config for additional domains**

``touch /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains``


**make default file read configs for additional domains**

``vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/fusionpbx``


Add the line below at the very end of the file after the trailing "}"

``include /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains;``


By now you are all set to start using SSL on multiple domains for your FusionPBX installation.


**Follow the steps below everytime your add a new domain**

Create a conf file for the new domain (repalce example.com with your own domain)

``vim /etc/letsencrypt/configs/example.com.conf``


Paste this into the .conf file (don't forget to change the defaults, especially the domain)

::

 # the domain we want to get the cert for;
 # technically it's possible to have multiple of this lines, but it only worked
 # with one domain for me, another one only got one cert, so I would recommend
 # separate config files per domain.
 domains = my-domain

 # increase key size
 rsa-key-size = 2048 # Or 4096

 # the current closed beta (as of 2015-Nov-07) is using this server
 server = https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

 # this address will receive renewal reminders
 email = my-email

 # turn off the ncurses UI, we want this to be run as a cronjob
 text = True

 # authenticate by placing a file in the webroot (under .well-known/acme-upatechallenge/)
 # and then letting LE fetch it
 authenticator = webroot
 webroot-path = /var/www/letsencrypt/


Obtain the cert from Let's Encrypt (again, replce example.com with your domain)

::

 cd /opt/letsencrypt
 ./letsencrypt-auto --config /etc/letsencrypt/configs/example.com.conf certonly


**Set cert to auto renew with other domains**

::

 cd /etc/fusionpbx
 vim renew-letsencrypt.sh
 
 
Add the line below right below where it says "cd /opt/letsencrypt/" (again replace example.com with your domain)

``./certbot-auto --config /etc/letsencrypt/configs/example.com.conf certonly --non-interactive --keep-until-expiring --agree-tos --quiet``


Finally add your new domain to be loaded

``vim /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains``


Paste the below at the very end of the file (again replace example.com with your domain)

::

 server {
         listen 443;
         server_name example.com;
         ssl                     on;
         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

         include /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-default-config;
 }
 
 
You're all set! Restart nginx for changes to take effect
 
 ``service nginx restart``
