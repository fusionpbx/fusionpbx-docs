# Let\'s Encrypt

Let\'s Encrypt is one of the most recent and widely used form of free
SSL security and supports wildcard DNS. You can use Let\'s Encrypt with
your FusionPBX install and WebRTC like [Verto
Communicator](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Verto+Communicator).

## Dehydrated (Recommended)

FusionPBX has an option to easily and quickly install SSL with Let\'s
Encrypt using **letsencrypt.sh** With this script you can choose either
to request an SSL certificate with wildcard (\*.domain.tld) or hostnames
(domain.tld).

The letsencrypt.sh will do the following:

-   Download [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated).
-   Request an SSL certificate from [Let\'s
    Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.com).
-   Configure NGINX to use the SSL certificate.
-   Combine and place the SSL certificate in the proper
    [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/FreeSWITCH+Explained)
    directory for using TLS.
-   Test and make sure the SSL cert works and outputs if successful.

### Using letsencrypt.sh

With letsencrypt.sh you have the choice of creating an SSL certificate
for a single domain (domain.tld), multiple subdomains (sub.domain.tld,
sub1.domain.tld, etc.domain.tld) or wildcard (\*.domain.tld). The easy
way however is using the hostname method.

#### Hostname

To create a hostname or multiple hostname SSL certificate go to:

    cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/debian/resources/

Then execute the script.

    ./letsencrypt.sh

You should then see and follow the prompts.

    Domain Name: domain.tld
    Email Address: support@fusionpbx.com

After that, you should see the following output.

When you define the txt record with your domain registrar be sure to use
the output of the script you are running and not what is in this
example.
::::

    Add the following to the zone definition of domain.tld:
    _acme-challenge.domain.tld. IN TXT "PY7ttk6no_5eG7WtAbO6qs5-NzA-Kigko375omKc0nw"

    **Press enter to continue...**

    + Responding to challenge for domain.tld authorization...
    + Challenge is valid!
    + Cleaning challenge tokens...

    Now you can remove the following from the zone definition of domain.tld:
    _acme-challenge.domain.tld. IN TXT "PY7ttk6no_5eG7WtAbO6qs5-NzA-Kigko375omKc0nw"

    **Press enter to continue...**

    deploy_cert()

    Done!

    **done**

:::: tip
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>

Use the dig command to check that the txt record is correct. dig -t txt _acme-challenge.domain.tld

Output should show:

##### Setup for multiple domains on Let\'s Encrypt

Before setting up multiple domains, make sure you have SSL working on
your main domain using the instructions above.

**Create shared nginx host file for all domains**

`vim /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-default-config`

Paste the code below into the file

    ssl_protocols           TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!ADH:!MD5:!aNULL;

    #letsencrypt
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
      root /var/www/letsencrypt;
    }

    #REST api
    if ($uri ~* ^.*/api/.*$) {
      rewrite ^(.*)/api/(.*)$ $1/api/index.php?rewrite_uri=$2 last;
      break;
    }

    #algo
    rewrite "^.*/provision/algom([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})\.conf" /app/provision/?mac=$1&file=algom%7b%24mac%7d.conf last;

    #mitel
    rewrite "^.*/provision/MN_([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})\.cfg" /app/provision/index.php?mac=$1&file=MN_%7b%24mac%7d.cfg last;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/MN_Generic.cfg" /app/provision/index.php?mac=08000f000000&file=MN_Generic.cfg last;

    #grandstriam
    rewrite "^.*/provision/cfg([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})(\.(xml|cfg))?$" /app/provision/?mac=$1;

    #aastra
    rewrite "^.*/provision/aastra.cfg$" /app/provision/?mac=$1&file=aastra.cfg;
    #rewrite "^.*/provision/([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})(\.(cfg))?$" /app/provision/?mac=$1 last;

    #yealink common
    rewrite "^.*/provision/(y[0-9]{12})(\.cfg)?$" /app/provision/index.php?file=$1.cfg;

    #yealink mac
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})(\.(xml|cfg))?$" /app/provision/index.php?mac=$1 last;

    #polycom
    rewrite "^.*/provision/000000000000.cfg$" "/app/provision/?mac=$1&file={%24mac}.cfg";
    #rewrite "^.*/provision/sip_330(\.(ld))$" /includes/firmware/sip_330.$2;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/features.cfg$" /app/provision/?mac=$1&file=features.cfg;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})-sip.cfg$" /app/provision/?mac=$1&file=sip.cfg;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})-phone.cfg$" /app/provision/?mac=$1;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([A-Fa-f0-9]{12})-registration.cfg$" "/app/provision/?mac=$1&file={%24mac}-registration.cfg";

    #cisco
    rewrite "^.*/provision/file/(.*\.(xml|cfg))" /app/provision/?file=$1 last;

    #Escene
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([0-9]{1,11})_Extern.xml$"       "/app/provision/?ext=$1&file={%24mac}_extern.xml" last;
    rewrite "^.*/provision/([0-9]{1,11})_Phonebook.xml$"    "/app/provision/?ext=$1&file={%24mac}_phonebook.xml" last;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    client_max_body_size 80M;
    client_body_buffer_size 128k;

    location / {
      root /var/www/fusionpbx;
      index index.php;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
      fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;
      #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
      fastcgi_index index.php;
      include fastcgi_params;
      fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/fusionpbx$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    # Disable viewing .htaccess & .htpassword & .db
    location ~ .htaccess {
      deny all;
    }
    location ~ .htpassword {
      deny all;
    }
    location ~^.+.(db)$ {
      deny all;
    }

**Create a file to contain config for additional domains**

`touch /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains`

**make default file read configs for additional domains**

`vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/fusionpbx`

Add the line below at the very end of the file after the trailing \"}\"

`include /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains;`

By now you are all set to start using SSL on multiple domains for your
FusionPBX installation.

**Follow the steps below every time you add a new domain**

Create a conf file for the new domain (replace example.com with your own
domain)

`vim /etc/letsencrypt/configs/example.com.conf`

Paste this into the .conf file (don\'t forget to change the defaults,
especially the domain)

    # the domain we want to get the cert for;
    # technically it's possible to have multiple of these lines, but it only worked
    # with one domain for me, another one only got one cert, so I would recommend
    # Separate config files per domain.
    domains = my-domain

    # increase key size
    rsa-key-size = 2048 # Or 4096

    # the current closed beta (as of 2015-Nov-07) is using this server
    server = https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

    # this address will receive renewal reminders
    email = my-email

    # turn off the ncurses UI, we want this to be run as a cronjob
    text = True

    # authenticate by placing a file in the webroot (under .well-known/acme-upatechallenge/)
    # and then letting LE fetch it
    authenticator = webroot
    webroot-path = /var/www/letsencrypt/

Obtain the cert from Let\'s Encrypt (again, replace example.com with
your domain)

    cd /etc/dehydrated/certs
    /usr/local/sbin/dehydrated -c -f /etc/dehydrated/config

**Set cert to auto-renew with other domains**

    cd /etc/fusionpbx
    vim renew-letsencrypt.sh

Add the line below right below where it says \"cd /opt/letsencrypt/\"
(again replace example.com with your domain)

> /usr/local/sbin/dehydrated -c -f /etc/dehydrated/config
> /usr/sbin/service nginx restart

Finally, add your new domain to be loaded

`vim /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-domains`

Paste the below at the very end of the file (again replace example.com
with your domain)

    server {
            listen 443 ssl;
            server_name example.com;
            ssl                     on;
            ssl_certificate /etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/fullchain.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/privkey.pem;

            include /etc/nginx/includes/fusionpbx-default-config;
    }

You\'re all set! Restart nginx for changes to take effect

> `service nginx restart`
