This law requires direct access to emergency numbers. This should have been default in the first place but some people need a law to tell them not to do something stupid like requiring a 9 in front of an emergency number.

Steps to set this up.

-   Create an Emergency Outbound route.
-   Set the emergency caller ID on the extension, domain-variables dialplan, or directly in the outbound routes.
-   Make sure your VoIP provider has 911 support and an address defined to match the number you are sending
-   Make a test call to 933 if the VoIP provider supports it if not call 911 and tell them it's a test call.
