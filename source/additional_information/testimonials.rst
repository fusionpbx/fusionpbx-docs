Businesses of all sizes use FusionPBX daily.  We love to see folks happy saving money using FusionPBX.  Here are some of the testimonials we received.

------------

*I've been a longtime VoIP enthusiast for years, since 2005, and I have tried several different hosted/self-hosted PBX systems. Honestly, FusionPBX wins hands down. What makes it even more amazing is the passion that the FusionPBX developers and contributors have in their software. I honestly couldn't be happier with a turn-key PBX system.

*Because of FusionPBX's highly configurable nature, responsive support team and sane design, SureVoIP have been able to win many large customers because proprietry systems are so rigid and slow to innovate. We have been proud to support and deploy FusionPBX for 7 years.*

I would like to tell everyone there that I have been trying to get an open source PBX to work for me for over three months now and since I am not a linux guy, I havenâ€™t been able to get any of them working the way I wanted. FusionPBX installation script installed ALL required packages and libraries in one go and it was up and running in 10 mins. Once I followed the `youtube videos <https://www.youtube.com/fusionpbx>`_ It took me no time to setup and migrate my clients to FusionPBX. One of the best features I love in FusionPBX is the automatic dialplan expression as I have always struggled with remembering the expression syntax. The user interface and the way all the features are grouped is awesome.

*Again, Thanks for the effort*
