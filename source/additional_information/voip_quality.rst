Voip Quality
##################


Several factors can attribute to the quality of a Voip call.  Most problems with Voip quality can be narrowed down to packet loss, jitter, wrong configurations, high latency and network attacks.

Packet Loss
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Packet loss happens when a defined number of packets don't all reach their destination.  Most commonly, this can happen from faulty network hardware and wiring.  Network saturation can be a culprit also on the WAN and LAN of a network.

0% packet loss is recommended.

Jitter
^^^^^^^

Packets that don't arrive in the intended order or proper time will result in jitter.  This will sound like robotic voice or missing audio that sounds choppy.  Much like a cell phone conversation with poor reception. 

3 ms in jitter or less is recommended.


Latency
^^^^^^^^

Too high of latency will result in conversational timing issues. This sounds like two people talking at the same time. 

150 ms or less is recommended.



Wrong Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Quality Of Service QOS when implimented correctly on a network device can help a network provide great Voip quality. 
* ISP provisions your cable modem the wrong speed profile.


Network Attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are in the age of the internet wild wild west. Network attacks depending on size can bring a voip call quality sounding like packet loss, jitter and latency kind of calls.
