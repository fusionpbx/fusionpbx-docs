* This law requires direct access to emergency number. This should have been default in the first place but some people need a law to tell them not to do something stupid like requiring a 9 in front of an emergency number.
   * Steps to set this up.
      * Create an Emergency Outbound route.
      * Set the emergency caller ID on the extension, domain-variables dialplan, or directly in the outbound routes.
      * Make sure your VoIP provider has 911 support and an address defined to match the number you are sending
      * Make a test call to 933 if the VoIP provider supports it if not call 911 and tell them its a test call.
