Businesses of all sizes use FusionPBX daily. We love to see folks happy
saving money using FusionPBX. Here are some of the testimonials we
received.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*I\'ve been a longtime VoIP enthusiast for years, since 2005, and I have
tried several different hosted/self-hosted PBX systems. Honestly,
FusionPBX wins hands down. What makes it even more amazing is the
passion that the FusionPBX developers and contributors have in their
software. I honestly couldn\'t be happier with a turn-key PBX system.*

### Digital Crisis

express our gratitude to Mark and the team for not only providing a

Have been using FusionPBX since 2010. SureVoIP sponsored the first
versions of multi-tenant domains and hot desking. SureVoIP sponsors and
contributes fixes and features when possible.

*Because of FusionPBX\'s highly configurable nature, responsive support
team and sane design, SureVoIP have been able to win many large
customers because proprietry systems are so rigid and slow to innovate.
We have been proud to support and deploy FusionPBX for 7 years.*

I would like to tell everyone there that I have been trying to get an
open source PBX to work for me for over three months now and since I am
not a linux guy, I haven't been able to get any of them working the way
I wanted. FusionPBX installation script installed ALL required packages
and libraries in one go and it was up and running in 10 mins. Once I
followed the [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/fusionpbx) it took
me no time to setup and migrate my clients to FusionPBX. One of the best
features I love in FusionPBX is the automatic dialplan expression as I
have always struggled with remembering the expression syntax. The user
interface and the way all the features are grouped is awesome.

*Again, Thanks for the effort*

FusionPBX Will Be My Default Choice From Now On.

I just did my first install of FusionPBX a few days ago. All my prior
background has been in the Asterisk/FreePBX community. But my
introduction to the freeSWITCH/FusionPBX community has been a very
pleasant one. The change does include a small learning curve, but the
advantages far out way the effort required to learn the new platform.
Suddenly a lot of prior headaches and work arounds are gone. The install
is painless and simple compared to FreePBX. And after it is installed it
works! This is especially note worthy if you are used to trying to get
everything working with FreePBX on a VPS. This worked perfect on a VPS.

Now for the more practical end of things. I found the features and
functionality of FusionPBX to be very comprehensive. The monitoring and
control you have over active calls is second to none. And unlike most
GUI\'s you do not need to sacrifice functionality for the use of a GUI.
With the dial plan manager you can easily add almost any custom dial
plan that you could by editing the xml directly. And as if that is not
enough, there is a built in editor for all the xml and config files.

The support for this project is also noteworthy and it is quite easy to
get direct access to the lead developer himself.

Hope that helps. And I highly encourage you to give FusionPBX a try.

Regards,

Amazingly fast to get up and running, but equipped with very powerful
functionality as well.

I came from a Trixbox background. I had experienced limitations with the
Trixbox solution and was looking for an alternative when I found
FusionPBX. The first thing that amazed me was how simple and speedy it
was to get a working phone system up and running with FusionPBX - far
simpler than Trixbox. But then I started to discover how much advanced
functionality was also available, and how extensible the design is - in
my opinion it is far easier to script for FusionPBX than to script for
Trixbox if you want to add additional functionality of your own.
FusionPBX is clearly a well thought through design, built on a very
solid underlying soft switch (FreeSWITCH) - for me that makes it the
system of choice.
