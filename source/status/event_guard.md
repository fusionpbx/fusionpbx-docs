## Event Guard

This is an optional service called event[guard]{#guard} and it was
designed to protect your VoIP server. It watches registration events and
blocks those that abuse it. It doesn\'t watch server logs. It currently
supports iptables and pf firewalls. Netfilter firwall support will be
added in the future.

Event guard logs blocked and unblocked calls to Status -\> Event Guard.
Event guard uses the Advanced -\> Access Control allowed nodes as a
white list. Can add a new Access Control List called Customers or any
name you like set to default deny then add the customer CIDR to a new
node set as allowed.

Event Guard also looks at the current allowed IP addresses and trusts
these registered IP addresses that were authenticated.
