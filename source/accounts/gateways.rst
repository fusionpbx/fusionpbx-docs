Gateways
=========

Gateways define the location and settings for other VoIP servers or Providers. After defining the Gateways use the Outbound routes to direct calls through the gateways.

`Check out the Youtube video <https://youtu.be/YKOTACDYQ3A>`_ .

**In this example we will be using** `VoiceTel <http://tiny.cc/voicetel>`_ .  **Each Gateway provider has their own setings to use.**

Basic Gateway Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Gateway:**  Name the Gateway.
* **Username:** This is specific and typically given by the carrier.
* **Password:** This is specific and typically given by the carrier.
* **From User:** This is specific and typically given by the carrier.
* **From Domain:** This is specific and typically given by the carrier.  This will be the domain your FusionPBX connects to for sending calls.
* **Proxy:** Proxy server address used by the carrier. This will vary by carrier.
* **Realm:** This is specific and typically given by the carrier. Most times will be blank.  Only used by some carriers
* **Expire Seconds:** Time until the registration to the carrier expires.

* **Enabled:** If the gateway is enabled or disabled.
* **Description:** A way to organize if you use more than one gateway.


Advanced Gateway Settings

Most settings in the Advanced Gateway Settings can remain the same.  Some carriers will require slight changes in this section to help with outbound caller ID.

* **Distinct To:** 
* **Auth Username:** 
* **Extension:** Mostly used for testing and not for production. Hard codes a set number and all calls would be hard coded to that number for inbound calls from that gateway.

* **Register Proxy:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the register proxy. host[:port].
* **Outbound Proxy:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the outbound proxy. host[:port].
