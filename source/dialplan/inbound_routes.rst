Inbound Routes
################

Route incoming calls to destinations based on one or more conditions. It can send incoming calls to:

* IVR Menu
* Call Group
* Extension
* External Number
* Script

Order is important when an anti-action is used or when there are multiple conditions that match. 

**Inbound routes can be used for advanced reasons**.  `Dialplan > Destinations <http://docs.fusionpbx.com/en/latest/dialplan/destinations.html>`_ **will create and configure the Inbound Route for you.**
