Call Flow Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Call Flow example below we have the name as Call Flow.  Made the Extension number 30 that didn't exist until now.  Feature code we made with a *code as *30.  Kept the context as is with `training.fusionpbx.com`_ . Status to show which mode. Made a pin number to help secure the call flow. Made the detination label as Day Mode. Picked a sound to familiarize which mode is activated. Choose a destination for the alternative mode. Made the alternative detination label as Night Mode. Picked an alternative sound to familiarize which mode is activated. Choose a destination for the alternative mode. Finally describe what this call flow does.
