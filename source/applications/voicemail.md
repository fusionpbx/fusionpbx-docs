### Email Setup/Default Settings
Click the link for setting up email server settings: [Email Setup/Default Settings](http://docs.fusionpbx.com/en/latest/advanced/default_settings.html#email). These are the settings needed to enable your FusionPBX installation to send email notifications.

### Voicemail Variables
Using switch variables provides the ability to adjust FusionPBX Voicemail features. These variables can be set in either **Dialplan > Global Variables** or per domain with **Domain Variables Dialplan**.

#### Leave a Voicemail

| Name                      | Value          |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| skip_greeting             | true or false  |
| skip_instructions         | true or false  |
| voicemail_greeting_number | 0-9            |
| vm_disk_quota             | 0-3600 seconds |
| vm_message_ext            | wav or mp3     |

#### Check Voicemails

| Name                      | Value          |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| voicemail_authorized      | true or false  |
| vm_say_caller_id_number   | true or false  |
| vm_say_date_time          | true or false  |

:::{note}

The 'wav' format is the default voicemail message file type. A value of 'mp3' requires *mod_shout* be installed and running.   
:::

### Not Found Message
When an extension is unavailable and no voicemail is configured, there is an option to play a message to the caller alerting them to this.

To enable/disable this, change the option for the **not_found_message** setting in **Advanced > Default Settings > Voicemail** category to suit your preference.

Please note that enabling this option means that the call must be answered in order to play the message to the caller, and so the call will complete with a 200 OK rather than a 480 Unavailable or 486 Busy. In some jurisdictions, this could potentially be illegal as it turns an otherwise toll-free call into a chargeable one.

## Voicemail Transcription
FusionPBX supports Voicemail Transcription, where emails will include a transcribed version of the voicemail the email was sent in regards to. To configure this feature, see [Voicemail Transcription](http://docs.fusionpbx.com/en/latest/applications/voicemail_transcription.html).
