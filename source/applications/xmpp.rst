        :scale: 75%
        
| on the right to create a profile.         

| In this example we will setup Google Talk and by creating a profile called gtalk. 

::

 Profile Name: gtalk
 Username: your_user_account@gmail.com (use your account)
 Password: use the correct password
 Auto-Login: yes
 XMPP Server: talk.google.com

| Two approaches can be used for the next part.

| **Option 1.**

| Lets say my gmail number was 13051231234. This approach will send the inbound calls to the inbound routes with a destination number that is the default extension number that is set.

::

 Default extension: 13051231234
 Advanced -> Context: public


| **Option 2.**

| On a single tenant system. This will send the call to extension 1001 in the default context.

::

 Default extension: 1001
 Advanced -> Context: default

| **Option 3.**

| On a single tenant system. This will send the call to extension 1001 in the multi-tenant domain name.

::

 Default extension: 1001
 Advanced -> Context: your.domain.com

| Save the settings and restart the module. Restart the 'XMPP' module from Advanced -> Modules page. 
| Go back to Accounts -> XMPP if the status says **'AUTHORIZED'** then you are ready to go.

| **Note** If you are not getting AUTHORIZED you might need to goto the google account settings and choose "Allow less secure apps: ON" under the Sign-in & security section.

|

| **Outbound Routes**

| For this example we will use 11 digit dialing.

::

 Gateway: XMPP
 Dialplan Expression: 11 digits
 Description: Google Talk
 Press Save

| If your XMPP profile is named something other than gtalk edit the outbound route you just created.
| Bridge statement should look like: dingaling/gtalk/+$1@voice.google.com replace gtalk with the profile name you chose and then save it.

|
