Operator Panel is a simple and easy way to use the FusionPBX web interface to make calls from, login and out of queues and call center.  You can see the status of other users also depending on what permissions are set to the user.

       Make sure in Accounts > Extensions that the extension is assigned to the user.  This will enable Operator Panel for that user.
