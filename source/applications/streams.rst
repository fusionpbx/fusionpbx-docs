.. Note::

 Editing a stream path will result in having to update anything that is using the stream.  For example, if you have extension 500 using stream "Local Weather" and you edit the shout:// path then you will have to go back to extension 500 and reset the music on hold for extension 500.  This is by design.


.. Warning::

  Please be aware of your countries copyright laws for streaming the content you are going to stream.
