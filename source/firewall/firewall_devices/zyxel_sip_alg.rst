How to Disable SIP ALG

                Log into the router and navigate to Configuration -> Network -> ALG

                Uncheck the following to disable SIP ALG:

                                * Enable SIP ALG

                                * Enable SIP Transformations

                                * Enable Configure SIP Inactivity Timeout

                                * Restrict Peer to Peer Signaling Connection

                                * Restrict Peer to Peer Media Connection

Click the Apply button at the bottom of the page.  A reboot should not be necessary, but if youâ€™re still experiencing issues then it is a good idea to try rebooting the router and testing again.
