Fail2ban is also used to protect SSH, FreeSWITCH, the web server as well as other services. You can view the IP addresses blocked by Fail2ban with the following command.


::
 
 iptables -L -n
 

To check the status of one of the fail2ban jails

::

 fail2ban-client status freeswitch-ip-tcp


Fail2ban configuration files are located in.

::

 cd /etc/fail2ban/


To exclude an IP so that it isn't blocked by any filters edit the **jails.conf** file.


::

 nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf


Find ignoreip and add the IP address, CIDR or DNS hostname that need to be white listed. Use a space as a delimitter between each one. Restart fail2ban to apply the changes to the ignoreip list.

::

 ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 192.168.0.0/16


Filters are defined in the following directory.

::

 /etc/fail2ban/filter.d


Inside jail.local points to filters and defines maxretry, bantime, logpath, ports to block and more.

::

 /etc/fail2ban/jail.local


Clear all blocked addresses by restarting fail2ban.

::

  service fail2ban restart


Fail2ban logs the addresses that it blocks with the filter that triggered it.

::

  /var/log/fail2ban.log

.. Note::

    You can use a dynamic ip address service like dyndns to whitelist a dynamic ip address.
