Extension
==========

| **Extension** What is used to register the phone (typically your
  extension number but can be any alphanumeric) used to register phone
  in the field user ID, username etc.
|  **Number Alias** The number you can dial to get this extension if the
  extension is non numerical.

| **Range** used to setup one or more extensions. In other words this
  can be used to create extension in bulk from 1 to 1000 extensions.
| If the checkbox for Auto-generate user with extension as login name is
  checked, User List is ignored, and a user is created and linked to the
  extension.
| A printable List of usernames and randomly generated passwords is
  dumped to screen so can capture them for later.

| **``Effective`` ``Caller`` ``ID``
  ``Name:``**\ `` is used when calling internal numbers. ( ``\ **```effective_caller_id_name`` <http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable_effective_caller_id_name>`__**\ `` - FreeSWITCH variable )``
| **``Effective`` ``Caller`` ``ID``
  ``Number:``**\ `` is used when when calling internal numbers. ( ``\ **```effective_caller_id_number`` <http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable_effective_caller_id_number>`__**\ `` - FreeSWITCH variable )``
| ``The Effective Caller Name and Number are also used to populate the voicemail Subject line information.``

| **``Outbound`` ``Caller`` ``ID``
  ``Name:``**\ `` is used when calling external numbers. ( ``\ *```outbound_caller_id_name`` <http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2010-February/053648.html>`__*\ `` - General variable )``
| **``Outbound`` ``Caller`` ``ID``
  ``Number:``**\ `` is used when calling external numbers. ( ``\ *```outbound_caller_id_number`` <http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2010-February/053648.html>`__*\ `` - General variable )``

| ``Caller ID notes:``
| ``Effective caller id is the real caller id however people tend to like and internal caller id for extensions and an external caller id when calling ``
| ``out the gateways so when calling out a gateway if you were to look at the outbound route in the edit window as a superadmin users you would see``
| ``that when going out the gateway it sets the outbound caller id to the effective caller id the effect is this on the extension you set the effective``
| ``caller id to the internal caller id info the number as the extension number then you set the outbound caller id as the external caller id.  This is``
| ``used to set the outbound caller ID effective_caller_id_name=${outbound_caller_id_name}.  The Outbound caller ID variable doesn't exist in FreeSWITCH,``
| ``it is a feature of FusionPBX.  You can set the caller id either on an outbound route or on an extension.``

**Account Code** - this is not used anywhere in the default dialplan but
is provided in FreeSwitch and therefore is provided in FusionPBX for
full compatibility. It sets a variable for the extension that could be
used in a condition. See `Variable
accountcode <http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable_accountcode>`__
for more information. Note that it can be used to affect the operation
of CDR.
